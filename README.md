# Project Todos

I created a to do app using React, Redux, JSX, and styled components. The user can add/remove tasks, see all tasks in a list, and toggle when a task is completed.

## The problem

I started by creating the store with an initial state and reducers. Then I divided the project into different components to make the code easier to read/follow. The components were mounted into the accurate places to make the project work. I used filter methods to toggle/delete tasks.

In the AllTasks.js component I used ternary operators to render differently depending on what the status of the task list is. If all tasks in the list are completed there will be a confetti rain, which is imported from the Confetti React library.

I wanted a colourful design and saw the opportunity to try something new. The background I created by customising a background on https://bgjar.com/. If I had more time I would have implemented a timestamp on the tasks for when they are created, and also the opportunity to add a due date. I would also add categories to the tasks.
