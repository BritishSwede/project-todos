# To Do App

I created a To Do App using React, Redux, and styled components. You can add tasks to the list, mark them as completed, and delete them.

## The problem

I found this project quite simple to make and was able to find a lot of resources online about similar projects. My biggest issue this week was lack of time. If I had more time I would have added more features to the app, e.g. timestamps and filter possibilities.
